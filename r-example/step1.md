# Don't Be Scared!

None of the commands we're going to ask you to do can hurt anything â€“ they are only "looking around" commands, not anything dangerous.

In fact, you can do them on your own linux or linux-like operating system (say, your Mac, or a linux VM).  So, if you want to try out what we're doing here, but in the "real world", go ahead!

# You Are Here.

You can find out where you are in a computer directory structure by typing `pwd`, which stands for "present working directory". Go ahead and try it!  You'll see a "path" that consists of directory names separated by slashes.  For example, if the path was /home/smithj/test_dir, this means that the highest level directory in the system is `home`, and within that directory, there is a directory called `smithj`, and inside of `smithj`, there's a directory called `test_dir`, and that's your present working directory.  Any commands you run (like "make me a new file" or "make me a new directory") will be executed here, in your present working directory (or `pwd`)!
