# Katacoda

In a *real* scenario we'd have a couple of filler slides to get us past the startup delay, and each step would be incremental, slowly walking learners through some actions.  Then we'd have a final slide on which the "Continue" would take the learner to the finish screen (not currently configured).

OK, enough stalling... Hit the "Continue" Button!
