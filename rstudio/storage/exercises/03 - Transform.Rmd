```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

covid_testing <- read_csv("covid_testing.csv") 
```


Create a dplyr pipeline that: 

1. Starts with the *covid_testing* data frame, then

2. Filters to tests that were sent from the PICU (Hint: `clinic_name` equal to "picu"), then

3. Selects the column with the received-to-verified turnaround time (`rec_ver_tat`) as well as the column with the day from start of the pandemic (`pan_day`)

```{r}
______ %>% 
  filter(______) %>% 
  select(______, ______) 
```





Add a column named "total_tat" to *covid_testing* that contains the total turnaround time (i.e. the sum of `col_rec_tat` and `rec_ver_tat`) for each test. 

```{r}
mutate(______, total_tat = ______)
```





Now re-write the previous code chunk to use the %>% operator.

```{r}

```
