# Moving Around

You can "change directory" by using the `cd` command.  

You can go "up" a level to the directory that contains your present working directory by using the `..` notation, like this: `cd ..`.  Note there's a space between `cd` and `..`.

You can go up two levels by using a slash and two more dots: `cd ../..`.  You get the idea!

You can go "down" into a directory that is within your present working directory by just typing `cd name-of-directory`.

Try it here, with `cd log_files`.

# Helper Functionality!

Click below if you don't feel like typing (although typing is really good for building muscle memory).

`cd log_files`{{execute}}
